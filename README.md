## Project Description 
## Overview
This package simulates a Multi-agent system for search and rescue missions where we use turtlebot3 package in ROS Noetic. Our multi-agent system consists of 2- robots that are each specialized for a certain task. 5 turtlebots will be simulated as threats and another 5 turtlebots will be simulating the behavior of security forces (SWAT). The objective of the SWAT bots is to neutralize the threats and then go on to rescue the hostages. The SWAT knows the location of the hostages.

This software is a stepping stone in developing and studying the interaction between security forces and the adversaries. The objective is run all the swat bot simultaneously without bumping into each other.

## Background
The project will help us to gain insight as to how ROS Noetic, Gazebo and RViz works. The goal is to have understanding as to how services and nodes work. Gazebo and Rviz was another tool which we plan to learn through this project

## Deliverables
* Project: Muti-Agent Search and Rescue
* Overview of prosposed work, including risks, mitigation, timeline

## AIP Development

This project will be completed using AIP process with the involvement of 3 programmers using Pair-programming in turns. One of the programmer would be driver while other 2 would be navigator and design keeper. The detailed Product Backlog, Iteration Backlogs and Work Log are mentioned in the link given below :

## World
* We created a custom gazebo world which could simulate the requirements for our project

* For the custom world, we also generated a binary occupancy grid, loaded in rviz

## How to Run the ROS Package
### Build Instructions and running package
```
cd <your_catkin_ws>/src
https://github.com/mahimaarora2208/multi_agent_search_rescue.git
cd ..   
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro noetic -y
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash

roslaunch multi_agent_hostage_rescue main.launch

```
Open a new terminal and source it. To run the finder node:

```
rosrun multi_agent_hostage_rescue finder
```

### ROS Run TESTS
Run the following commands to test your test cases:
```
catkin_make run_tests -i

```

## To Generate and Check code coverage
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

## To Generate Doxygen Documentation
open your terminal in your repository
```
doxywizard
```
Follow steps in GUI after selecting path of your repository.
